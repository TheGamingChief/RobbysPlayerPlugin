# RobbysPlayerPlugin
RobbysPlayerPlugin is a BattlEye-Extended-Controls (BEC) plugin originally created by Robbyjm ([Github Profile](https://github.com/robbyjm/)) and ThePyrotechnic ([Github Profile](https://github.com/ThePyrotechnic)). This plugin displays the number of players currently on your server. I've made a few edits to fix a few errors that can happen.

## Setup

You must already have BEC setup with your server before adding this plugin.

### Written Instructions:
 - Create a folder named "Plugins" inside of your BEC folder (assuming you don't already have one).
 - Create a folder to hold this plugin, this can be named anything but I named mine "PlayerCount".
 - Inside of the folder you just created either download the `__init__.py` file and place it inside of the folder, or create a new file named `__init__.py`.
 - You can now open the `__init__.py` file and make any changes to the config you would like.
 - Once you start BEC the plugin should automatically get started.

### Video
I have a video on my channel that covers setting up and configuring this plugin.
